## Subjective perceptions
Assessing human perceptions of the urban environment is beneficial for decision-making to improve the environment. We collected subjective perception ratings from Shenzhen residents on street view images in Shenzhen to help construct a local perception dataset. The dataset includes subjective perceptions and SVI visual features. Subjective perceptions comprise beautiful, wealthy, boring, depressing, lively, and safe.

We invited a total of 200 local residents to participate in the survey.

## SVI visual features
Yolo V7 and DeepLab V3+ trained using ADE20k were used to detect information of elements of SVIs.
